# Delta 18 O (δ18O) Dataset

## Overview

This dataset comprises two columns: "age_CE" and "d18O." The "age_CE" column represents chronological ages in Common Era (CE), while the "d18O" column contains delta 18 O (δ18O) measurements. δ18O is a vital isotopic proxy used in paleoclimatology to infer past climate conditions.
