# TemporalTales-Delta18OAnalysis

Welcome to TemporalTales-Delta18OAnalysis! Explore Earth's climate history, analyze delta 18 O data, uncover insights about the 4.2K event, and visualize past climate variations.

## About This Repository

This repository is a resource for understanding Earth's climate history and the analysis of delta 18 O data. It provides insights into the 4.2K event, a significant period in Earth's climatic past. Additionally, it demonstrates how different proxies can be used to understand historical climate conditions.

## Features

- **Educational Jupyter Notebook**: Explore a Jupyter notebook designed to educate undergraduates, specifically at the ADIPEC conference. This interactive notebook teaches about the 4.2K event and illustrates how various proxies can be employed to study past climates.

- **Temporal Change Visualization**: Learn how to visualize the temporal change of proxies, such as delta 18 O and dolomite percentage. Discover how these proxies serve as valuable climate indicators of the past.

- **Interactive Game**: Engage in a game that challenges participants to identify plots that have captured the 4.2K event. Gain insights into the significance of these locations in Earth's climate history.
